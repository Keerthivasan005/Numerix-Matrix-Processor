# Numerix-Matrix-Processor
Code for matrix manipulations and calculations The aim of the project is to do basic operations on matrices in python. This was my introductory project in python. The following are the tasks performed by the Program:

1) Addition of Matrices.
2) Scalar Multiplication of Matrices.
3) Multiplication of Matrices.
4) Transpose of Matrix along: i. Main Diagonal. ii. Side Diagonal. iii. Vertical Line. iv. Horizontal Line.
5) Calculation of Determinant.
6) Calculation of Inverse of Matrix
